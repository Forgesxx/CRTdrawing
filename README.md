This project is intendent to replace existing demo app for Physic course.

1. Make it launchable on all systems: Web page can be opened in all browsers. It will make students be independent of devices they have.
2. Apps becomes obsolete. It could be possible they will not be launchable on future versions of Windows.
3. Existing apps has bugs:
 - russian laguage only. What about international students at least?
 - Formulas Labels are not the same as in application: 
  - "h" in book, and "y" in application
  - "Vz" in book, and "Vx" in application
 - ray deflection should be from the middle of plates, not from beggining

With all below, totally it makes demotivating effect on students.

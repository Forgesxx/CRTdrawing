This project is intended to replace the existing demo app for the Physic course.

1. Make it launchable on all systems: the Web page can be opened in all browsers. It will make students independent of the devices they have.
2. Apps become obsolete. It could be possible they will not be launchable on future versions of Windows.
3. Existing apps have bugs:
 - russian language only. What about international students at least?
 - Formula labels are not the same as in application: 
  - "h" in book, and "y" in application
  - "Vz" in the book, and "Vx" in the application
  - formula for Vx(Vz) that in the book, does not give us the result, that the application gives. But that result, that application gives - give us another formula, but that formula is absent in the book.
 - ray deflection should be from the middle of plates, not from the beginning

All of the below have a demotivating effect on students.
